# Prerequisites

You will need an established Red Hat Partner Connect account. This tool will not
create this for you. 

You will need a Connect API Token to use this tooling, set to either the
`PRODUCTCTL_API_TOKEN` environment variable, or in your configuration file at
the `api-token` key.

### Getting an API token:
